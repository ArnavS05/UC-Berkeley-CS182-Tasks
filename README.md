Few tasks done by me from UC Berkeley's CS182 course on Deep Learning.


## Tasks done by me:
1. [Spring 2022 Homework 2](https://github.com/cs182sp22/cs182_hw2_student) on RNN and Conv. nets. My implementation can be seen in the "cs182_hw2_student" folder in this repository.
2. [Spring 2022 Homework 4](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lLHAuIs4YW2tmG8Mhbc7VgvM7oiFev0E?usp=sharing) on ViT and Masked Autoencoder. My implementation can be seen in the "cs182_hw4_colab" folder in this repository.
